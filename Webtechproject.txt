Why do we have a cloud database?
Since we are deploying it to heroku ,and due to everyone has different OS we tend to use cloud database

Mongoose which is a package that we're going to install with
NPM and this is it basically allows us to model our data and it gives us a bunch of methods to interact
with our database so we can call like dot finder dots remove or whatever we want to do with our database

We're going to be crypt J.S. which is used for password encryption.
We're going to use something called Express validator for data validation.
We're gonna use a package called config for global variables.
We're going to use gravatar for profile avatars how that works is if a user signs up they can use
we need JWT because we're using JWT to pass along a token for validation.

Now we're going to install a couple Dev dependencies
we need nodemon which will constantly watch our server so that we don't have to refresh it every time

And then we also want concurrently which is going to allow us to run our back end express server and react at the same time

Async Await 
Used for making JS promises simpler 


For models > user.js
it's a mongoose dot model which takes in two things the model name which is user and the the schema.
So the user schema which we just created and that's it.
